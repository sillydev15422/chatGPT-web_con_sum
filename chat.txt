 am looking for a comprehensive dashboard solution that enables users to input a website URL or upload a CSV file containing multiple URLs. The dashboard should then extract and store various details about each website in a database. Users should have the option to download all fields or select specific fields for certain websites.



The dashboard will crawl up to 25 links from a single homepage provided by the user, and these 25 links will be sent to GPT-3.5T as embeddings to retrieve the following details:



Web Summary: A detailed summary of the website, including its purpose and offerings. For example, if the URL is http://openai.com, the summary should describe what OpenAI does and the various tools and options it provides.
Features: A comprehensive list of tools, products, and features available on the website, such as those found on http://openai.com.
Pricing: A detailed breakdown of the different pricing options available on the website, if applicable. If pricing information is not available, the output should indicate that pricing details are not available.
Please let me know if you can develop such a solution, along with the estimated time and cost involved in its creation.
